<body p1 style="color:white; text-align:left; font-size: 20px">     For my final project, I decided to continue what I enjoyed most when working with programs in my Art 74 which is adobe after effects. I wanted to do something better than my last after effects project I first did and do something with words than action. Screamo music is something I listen to privately because itâ€™s something that holds dear to me and people tend to not listen to the lyrics because it has a powerful meaning. Music changes people's life and learning new bands that have content like this is one of the best feelings to witness. This video is one of my favorites to watch when it was on youtube because the lyrics and the visualls is really amazing and can feel the emotion coming from it. I decided to put the lyrics into the video with a 3D effect on after effects which was really time consuming to make going through trial and errors. Inserting lyrics into every line with the video was something I wanted to try out and I feel this came out really well. There was a lot of challenges when working on this project and it took longer than expected. I was looking for ideas and this popped up and wanted to try it out myself. The positives challenges that I encountered was finding the right fonts for the lyrics to look creative. The layers and putting the lyrics in the right direction was the positive factors that I went through. I feel there were more difficulties than finding positive facts about this project. The 3D double screen effect when creating the movements of the lyrics was the most challenging. I went through many errors where I had to start from scratch with the lyrics which got frustrating. Through the countless errors on this assignment I started learning my own techniques in figuring out how to perfect it and I eventually got it to work which was the best takeaway. I feel like I am learning skills in figuring out solutions to fixing problems I go through working with these programs. It's a good feeling to finish the video even though I worked countless hours and struggles which I feel it was all worth it. What I am going to do moving forward with digital media is to continue learning new techniques with video editing because it is something I always wanted to learn and work on in the future. Youtube is something that I have been wanting to work on and learning this experience with different editing tools will help me in my future personal projects. I learned a lot in this class where I could use my own skills in working with programs on my own and also learn other peoples tutorial on helping me create something of my own. Adobe programs have always been my interest and this class gave me an opportunity to get a head start in learning the ropes to use it more in the future to come.
